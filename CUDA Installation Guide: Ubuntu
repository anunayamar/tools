#CUDA installation (Ubuntu)

1. Download the deb file from:
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=1604&target_type=deblocal

2. Check whether you already have cuda installed, if no follow the rest of the steps for the installation:
nvcc --version

3. Execute the following commands:
  
  a) sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-9-1-local_9.1.85-1_amd64.deb
  b) sudo apt-key add /var/cuda-repo-9-1-local/7fa2af80.pub
  c) sudo apt-get update
  d) sudo apt-get install cuda
  
  'sudo apt-get install cuda' was giving me some dependency error while installation.
  
  To overcome the error use the following commands:
  
  a) sudo apt-get install aptitude
  b) sudo aptitude install cuda
  
  When you will execute 'sudo aptitude install cuda', the commad will give you various options to resolve the dependencies.
  Read the options and make sure you choose the correct options that will lead to the installation of all the dependencies.
  
 4. Edit the bashrc:
 
    gedit ~/.bashrc 
    
    Add the following lines at the bottom of the file:
    
    #For cuda
    export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.1/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.1/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    
 5. Execute the following command:
  
    source ~/.bashrc
    
 6. Now check whether you have successfully installed the cuda compiler:
  
    nvcc --version
    
 7. Reboot the machine and you are done.
